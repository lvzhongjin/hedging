Background: Oil and NG prices have been extremely volatile in the past decade. The WTI oil price drops to as low as $60 after the 2009 financial crisis, then rises to around $100 between 2011 and 2014, and then declines precipitously to $30 in early 2016 before recovering to be around $60 in 2018. 
Objective: This project aims to extract the information on firms' hedging strategies and positions reported in their 10-K and 10-Q filings to SEC. Such informaton is extremly valuable to understand how firms respond to and deal with shocks to their revenue stream.
